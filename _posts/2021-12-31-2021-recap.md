This year I had no time to blog, so I spent some time on this final day for this brief recap of relevant stuff I accomplished in 2021.

## Quitting a job in June

I was totally burned out because of the toxic environment at my previous employer, so in spring I made the decision to quit there. After a journey of interviews lasting around two months, I eventually stumbled upon the right position at PagoPA S.p.A.: it is a very cool company, where I can finally do Scala programming at a professional level. So far I am very happy with the position! After a decade spent working for Italian companies, finally I found the right spot, where the tech people are eager to learn, to share ideas and to adopt the best engineering practices ü•∞.

## Smart working as new normal

By chance, this position should be full remote indefinitely besides COVID-19 evolution. That‚Äôs a game changer to me, since I am able to stay focused on my job duties in a cozy and familiar environment avoiding the annoying commuting. I was actually looking for a full remote position since 2015, maybe. Now, I have to admit, **I am professionally happier than ever**.

## Technical Development Editor @Manning

Also in 2021, I‚Äôve been a Technical Development Editor for two books: **Spring Boot in Practice** and **OpenID Connect in Action**. Both are very good ones! Besides my editor activities this experience has been useful to learn a lot of new stuff during the process.
Also, as a side note, I‚Äôve been the Technical Proofer of **Grokking Functional Programming**. This one is another gem, that can be very helpful for people willing to learn the basics of this programming paradigm.

## Open Source Contributor

This year I did not contribute too much to Open Source projects. I opened only few PRs to [camunda/feel-scala](https://github.com/camunda/feel-scala/) (it is an interpreter of [FEEL language](https://camunda.github.io/feel-scala/docs/reference/what-is-feel/)) and fixed some issues of [P3trur0/vue-country-flag](https://github.com/P3trur0/vue-country-flag/), that is a small Vue component I wrote some years ago. This was a tiny one, but it gained some traction and nowadays it used by 1.1k applications and it has around 75k monthly downloads. Because of this, even though it started as a toy component, now I have duties towards its small community of users complaining about some issues, such as converting it to a Vue3 component.

## Becoming a dad üë®üèª‚Äçüçº

Needless to say, it is the biggest achievement of my life. Accomplished on the 24th of August 2021, at 6.54 AM.
